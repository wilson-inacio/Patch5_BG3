# Scope
## Project Goals
Baldur's Gate 3 is a RPG game that was released for PCs on the 3rd of August 2023, and saw unprecedent acclaim. The game had a massive expansion on it's fifth patch, released November 30th, which included:
 - A new epilogue giving closure to some characters
 - Honour mode, a new difficulty mode with stricter rules and a single save file
 - Custom mode, allowing players to customize various gameplay settings
 - Performance improvements, particularly in Act 3
 - Quality of life inprovements throughout
With this project, rather than studying the lunch effects of the game, I'll estimate the causal effects of the post-launch content update of Patch 5 on engagement using a Difference-in-Differences framework.
